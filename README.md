# Airline-Ticket-Booking

Project Summary:

The goal of the project was to create a website that will find the cheapest flight from the user's origin.
The SkyScanner API is the API that was used to determine the cheapest flight from the origin to the destination, with the departing flight being set on the user provided start date, and the return flight being set on the user provided end date.
